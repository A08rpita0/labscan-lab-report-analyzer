"""Stage 5 - Disease risk scoring against the Disease Master.

Every detected cohort carries links into Disease Master rows. This stage pools those
links per disease and turns them into a transparent evidence score.

Combination rule - noisy-OR:

    score = 1 - PRODUCT over contributions of (1 - contribution)

Each contribution is  link_weight x cohort_confidence x role_factor.

Why noisy-OR rather than a sum:
  - it is bounded in [0, 1] with no arbitrary clipping
  - more independent evidence always raises the score, but with diminishing returns,
    so a disease cannot be pushed to certainty by piling on weak signals
  - each contribution stays individually inspectable, which is what makes the result
    explainable rather than a black box

Data sufficiency is scored separately and can only ever CAP the reported evidence
level, never raise it. A disease whose markers were mostly not measured is reported
as limited evidence with the missing parameters named, which is the honest answer.
