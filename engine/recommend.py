"""Stage 6 - Personalized action plan.

Recommendations come from three places, in priority order:
  1. Urgency - anything the clinical reference marks emergency or specialist-level.
  2. The clinical reference's own 'Prevention/Lifestyle Guidance' and 'Recommended Next Step'
     columns for each flagged condition. The master stays the source of truth for
     disease-level guidance; this engine does not paraphrase it.
  3. The action library in config/recommendations.json, keyed by detected cohort and
     by individual abnormal parameter.

Plus a follow-up testing block built from the parameters the risk engine identified as
missing, so the user is told concretely what would sharpen the picture.

Nothing here prescribes treatment or names a drug. Everything routes back to a clinician.
