"""Stage 2 and 3 - Normalization and abnormality detection.

Takes raw observations and produces the StandardizedPatient every later stage reads:
  - resolves each test name onto a canonical parameter via the alias index
  - converts the value into the canonical unit
  - picks the effective reference interval (the report's own range wins over the dictionary)
  - resolves duplicates and conflicts, recording what was dropped and why
  - computes derived parameters (ratios, eGFR-adjacent indices) only from present inputs
  - flags abnormality and assigns a severity grade

Rules that matter clinically:
  - A value is never invented. Missing stays missing.
  - A range printed on the patient's own report takes priority over the dictionary,
    because it reflects the assay and population the lab actually used.
  - Sex-specific dictionary ranges are used only when sex is known; otherwise the
    widest defensible interval is used and the parameter is annotated.
