"""Pipeline orchestration.

    Input -> Extraction -> Normalization -> Standardized Patient
          -> Cohort/Correlation Engine -> Disease Master -> Risk Engine (noisy-OR)
          -> Recommendation Engine -> Explainability -> Results

Each stage is independently testable and swappable; this module only wires them
together and assembles the enriched patient record that comes out the far end.

Every stage is timed with a monotonic clock. The timings are reported under `run`,
apart from the analysis itself: they are a measurement of this request on this machine,
not part of the result, so two runs of the same input still produce identical analyses.

    The validated configuration is loaded once per process and shared read-only. The
    stage objects are not shared: the Normalizer keeps working state on itself during
    build() (the rejected-value list, the patient context), so two requests analysed at
    once in a thread pool could in principle interleave it. A stress run did not
    reproduce that under the GIL, but correctness should not rest on scheduling luck.
    One Pipeline per thread is cheap - its constructor only wires the stages to the
    cached configuration.
