"""Stage 4 - Cohort / cluster detection.

Evaluates every configured cohort against the standardized patient. A cohort fires
when enough of its conditions are met AND enough of its parameters were actually
measured. Two evaluation modes:

  weighted  - fire when at least `min_triggers` distinct trigger conditions are met.
  count_of  - fire when at least `count_required` of the named components are met.
              Used where the clinical definition is itself a count (metabolic
              syndrome's 3-of-5, the ISTH DIC score, pancytopenia's 3 cell lines).

Confidence, 0..1, answers "how strongly does this patient show this pattern?" and is
built from three things:
  - how much of the cohort's weight actually fired
  - how severe the individual abnormalities are
  - how much of the expected data was available

Double counting is prevented by redundancy groups. LDL, non-HDL and ApoB all measure
atherogenic particle burden, so within one cohort only the strongest signal from each
redundancy group carries full weight; the rest are recorded but heavily discounted.
